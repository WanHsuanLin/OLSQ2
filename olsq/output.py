    By default: 1) the qasm sentences are separated by newline,

    3) from the measurement, we can read of the final mapping. 
    If in the original circuit (input to OLSQ) a qubit has index i,
    then it will be measured at c[i] in the qasm string.

    Args:
        device: use the same QC device as in OLSQ.setdevice()
        result_depth: depth of the scheduled circuit
        list_scheduled_gate_name: type/name of each gate
        list_scheduled_gate_qubits: which qubit(s) each gate acts on
        final_mapping: mapping from logical qubits to physical qubits
